Closed-loop buck and boost DC-DC converters using PID control in Matlab-Simulink
Closed-Loop DC-DC Converters (Buck and Boost)

This repository contains MATLAB/Simulink models of closed-loop buck and boost DC-DC converters using PWM-based PID voltage control. 
The models demonstrate output voltage regulation under reference and load variations, with annotated simulation results.

Tools used: MATLAB / Simulink
