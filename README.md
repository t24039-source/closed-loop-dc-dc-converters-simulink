Closed-loop buck and boost DC-DC converters using PID control in Matlab-Simulink
Closed-Loop DC-DC Converters (Buck and Boost)

This repository contains Simulink models of closed-loop buck and boost
DC-DC converters using PWM-based PID voltage control.

The models demonstrate output voltage regulation under reference
and load variations.

Tools used: MATLAB-Simulink
